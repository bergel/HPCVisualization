The left-most pane represents the calling context tree used in the Zeus benchmark. The size and color of each node indicates the time spent in it. The middle pane represent the context node grouped by their functions (a same function can appear in several contexts). The right most pane indicates the occurence of the context node across 512 different cores.

# How to load it?
You need Pharo in which Roassal2 is loaded. It is known to work with Pharo 7
